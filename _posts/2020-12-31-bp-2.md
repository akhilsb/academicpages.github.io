I received the best fresher award for fall 2020, for my work in blockchain protocols in lightweight embedded devices. I will write a blog post regarding this in the future where I will describe the network setup, the challenges and the accomplishments of this project. I heartfully thank Professor Bagchi and Professor Somali Chaterji for giving me the award.
